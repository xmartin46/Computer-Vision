Computer vision is a field that focuses on how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. It is amazing that humans and animals can reconstruct very easily objects' properties such as shape, illumination and color while computer vision algorithms are so error prone. Things like the illumination, scale and rotation of images make that computer vision systems see one thing or another completely different, even though humans know that it is the same object or place.

A computer vision system tries to classify objects. It is composed of several processes. In the first place, it has to process the image in order to get rid of or to make emphasis on some elements in the image. Afterwards, it segments the image to divide the elements of the image we want from those we do not want. Then, it extracts the descriptors of the image, i.e. the elements which are characteristic of that image. Finally, the system tries to recognize the object in the image comparing its descriptors with the ones in a database (models). Nevertheless, we can obtain objects' local features modifying the computer vision system. The only difference is that it no longer does the segmentation and descriptors extraction but it extracts features from the original (or pre-processed) image.

In this repository you will find laboratory sessions, where each of them focuses on some component of the computer vision system or on some techniques used in one of the components. Besides, there are two big projects. The first one tries to segment a chop image to compute its fat percentage. On the other hand, in the second project we created a full computer vision system (with segmentation and descriptors extraction) to classify types of flowers.

## First project: Detect the percentage of fat in chops images using binarization 
Mark 10/10
- [Meat Control Quality](https://github.com/xmartin46/VC/blob/master/Practica1/Deliverable/deliverable.pdf)

The aim of was assignment is to detect the percentage of fat in the images with chops using binarization.
## Second project: Detect types of flowers using features extraction

Mark 11/11
- [Flowers detection](https://github.com/xmartin46/VC/blob/master/Practica2/Deliverable/deliverable.pdf)

The aim of this assignment was to classify 12 different types of flowers using feature extraction.
